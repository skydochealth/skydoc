            SkyDoc is a concept created by <strong>Ayşe Melis Günal</strong>, a medical
            doctor and International Healthcare MBA candidate. The idea is born at the
            intersection of clinical practice, EMS emergency medicine and airline
            operations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project is currently in the
            <strong>exploratory and documentation phase</strong>. This website serves
            as a public snapshot of the idea for potential airline partners,
            investors and advisors.

          <h3>Vision</h3>
          <p>
            To become the aviation sector’s trusted telemedicine layer — providing
            data-driven support for in-flight medical events, reducing unnecessary
            diversions and strengthening passenger safety.

          <h3>Guided in-flight triage</h3>
          <p>
            Structured symptom checklists and severity scoring adapted from
            emergency medicine — simplified for cabin crew with limited space,
            equipment and time.

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Diversion decision support</h3>
          <p>
            A decision layer that brings together clinical severity, flight time
            to alternates and airline policy to support the captain’s final call
            on diversion vs continuation.
          </p>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Audit-ready documentation</h3>
          <p>
            Clean, time-stamped incident reports that can be securely shared with
            airline medical departments, insurers and regulators after landing.

            <h3>Cabin crew initiates SkyDoc</h3>
            <p>
              A medical incident is reported on board. Cabin crew open the
              SkyDoc interface on a tablet or secure device and start a guided
              assessment.

            <h3>Structured triage & vital details</h3>
            <p>
              The system prompts for key symptoms, timing, red flags and
              available vital signs, standardising what is communicated to
              ground teams.

          <div>
            <h3>Ground clinician consultation</h3>
            <p>
              A ground clinician reviews the case in real time, provides
              recommendations appropriate to onboard resources and flags
              potential need for diversion.

          <div>
            <h3>Diversion support & documentation</h3>
            <p>
              Final diversion decisions remain with the captain, but SkyDoc
              captures the full reasoning trail and generates a secure report
              for post-flight review.
